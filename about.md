# Bio

Within a year from his debut, American rapper, singer/songwriter, record producer and art director Ezediel went from being almost undiscovered to reaching over a million listenings independently, transcending the limitations of singular genres blending his dark unique vocal delivery, pained lyrics, hip-hop and nu-metal productions with complete opposite music waves and influences. 

Born D. Robert Wayne, 12th October 1991 in New York (USA), Ezediel grew up in a suburb of Manhattan and began immediately to explore different kinds of Arts as a young teenager. Due to a dysfunctional family background he was forced to frequently move around the globe: first United States and Italy during his childhood, then England and Japan as he got older. From the offspring of this journey Ezediel gradually bloomed under many different kinds of artistic stimuli: starting from being a Bachelor of Arts major and a student of every kind of visual and performing arts, composing, theatre, choreography, acting and cinema, to a complete infatuation for kinaesthesia, contemporary dance and full-contact martial arts (especially wrestling and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu as now a blue belt competitor, started in Tokyo). During the 2020 worldwide pandemic, Robert Wayne decided to undertake a professional career as a musician with the name of Ezediel, derived from - Hesediel (חֶסֶדִיאֵל) - the Archangel of freedom, benevolence and mercy and the code - 717 - as his birth time.
